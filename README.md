# 🚀 Internship Portfolio: Python Projects

This repository contains a collection of Python projects developed during my internship, focusing on GUI development, algorithm implementation, and software logic.📑

<h3>Table of Contents</h3>

🎮Project 1: Tic-Tac-Toe

🏦 Project 2: Bank Management

🐍 Project 3: Snake Game

<h2>🎮Project 1: Tic-Tac-Toe</h2> 

A Python-based graphical game featuring both local competition and an automated opponent.

<h3>✨ Key Features</h3>

<b>Dual Modes</b>: Support for local Multiplayer (1v1) and Single Player against a logic-based AI.

<b>Smart Logic</b>: The AI utilizes conditional logic to prioritize winning moves and block player threats.

<b>Interactive UI</b>: Built with Tkinter, featuring a responsive $3 \times 3$ grid and real-time status updates.

<b>Game Management</b>: Automated win/draw detection with an instant board reset feature.

<b>📂 Tech StackLanguage</b>: PythonLibrary: Tkinter (GUI)Logic: Conditional branching and state-checking algorithms.

 
<b>🚀 Quick Startbash</b>

cd Tic_Tac_Toe

python tic_tac_toe.py

<h2>🏦 Project2: Bank Management System</h2>
A secure desktop banking application featuring data persistence and a customized graphical interface.

<h3>✨ Key Features</h3>

Authentication: Full Register/Login flow with credentials stored securely in JSON files.


Financial Operations: Real-time balance updates for deposits and withdrawals (credits/debits).

Audit Trail: Automated logging of all activities into a transaction history view.

Custom UI: Enhanced visual experience using Tkinter’s canvas properties and background image integration.

<b>🛠️ Tech Stack</b>

Language: Python 3.x

Storage: JSON (File-based database)

GUI: Tkinter

<h2>🐍 Project 3: Snake Game </h2>
An enhanced version of the classic arcade game featuring an immersive environment, strategic barriers, and persistent data tracking.

<h3>✨ Key Features</h3>

<b>Courtyard Environment: </b> Unlike traditional blank-screen versions, this game features a detailed Courtyard background, creating a more engaging visual experience.

<b>Barrier Challenges: </b>Features high-risk barriers (obstacles) placed throughout the courtyard. The user must navigate through these hazards to survive and keep the game running.

<b>Competitive Scoring:</b> Implements a High Score system that saves the player's best record to a local highscore.txt file, allowing users to compete against their own previous bests.

<b>Responsive Control Logic:</b> Precision-based movement and collision detection to handle the interaction between the snake, the food, and the courtyard barriers.

🛠️ Tech Stack | Component | Technology | | :--- | :--- | | Language | Python 3.x | | Graphics | Tkinter  | | Data Persistence | File I/O (txt handling) | | Mechanics | Object-oriented collision algorithms |

<h4>Gameplay Logic:</h4> If the snake's head coordinates overlap with the barrier or boundary coordinates, the game resets and compares the final score against the value stored in highscore.txt.
To give your repository a professional and innovative finish, we can merge the Roadmap concept with a Signature that highlights your role as a creator. This ending frames you as someone who doesn't just finish tasks, but continuously iterates and improves.


<h2>🗺️ Roadmap & Future Enhancements</h2>
The journey doesn't end with these projects. I am committed to continuous iteration and plan to extend this repository with:

<b>Network Integration:</b> Transitioning the Tic-Tac-Toe engine into a real-time online multiplayer experience using Socket programming.

<b>Database Scaling:</b> Migrating from flat-file JSON storage to a robust SQL backend for the Bank Management System.

<b>Performance Visualization:</b> Developing a visual debugger to demonstrate how complex algorithms—like the Dual-Trie Search and Dijkstra’s Pathfinding—process data in real-time.
